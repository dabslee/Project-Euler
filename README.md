I recently decided that I wanted to go on a programming marathon, where I would try to solve as many Project Euler (PE) problems in C++, Java, and Python as I could, as fast as I could. We'll see where I go with this! As of 5/28/2019, I also added Excel/VBA, so starting with PE #34, I also include Excel/VBA solutions.

As programming speed was the target here, the actual quality of the programs may suffer in terms of commenting or optimization. All I can guarantee is that they work and that they were programmed quickly!

2/14/2019: Finished PE #1 in a total of 8 minutes.

2/15/2019: Finished PE #2 and #3 in a total of 5 minutes and 12 minutes, respectively.

2/16/2019: Finished PE #4, #5, and #6 in a total of 9, 11, and 6 minutes, respectively.

2/17/2019: Finished PE #7 in a total of 5 minutes.

2/18/2019: Finished PE #8, #9, and #10 in a total of 11, 7, and 8 minutes, respectively.

2/19/2019: Finished PE #11 in a total of 33 minutes.

2/24/2019: Finished PE #12 in a total of 19 minutes.

2/25/2019: Finished PE #13 and #14 in a total of 48 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively.

2/26/2019: Finished PE #15 in a total of 2 hours, 17 minutes! Had to refine and expand BigInteger.cpp extensively, which accounted for the brunt of the time.

2/27/2019: Finished PE #16 in a total of 4 minutes.

2/28/2019: Finished PE #17 in a total of 6 minutes.

3/2/2019: Finished PE #18.

3/4/2019: Finished PE #19.

3/7/2019: Finished PE #20.

3/13/2019: Finished PE #21.

3/24/2019: Finished PE #22, #23, #24, and #25 in a total of 12, 34, 5, and 7 minutes, respectively.

3/27/2019: Finished PE #26 in a total of 25 minutes.

3/30/2019: Finished PE #27 in a total of 15 minutes.

3/31/2019: Finished PE #28 and #29 in a total of 8 and 5 minutes, respectively.

4/1/2019: Finished PE #30 in a total of 6 minutes.

4/5/2019: Finished PE #31 in a total of 31 minutes.

5/3/2019: Finished PE #32 in a total of around 2 hours. It took me especially long partially due to a hiatus, and partially due to getting a new computer and needing to reinstall and reconfigure all my programming tools.

5/4/2019: Finished PE #33 in a total of 43 minutes.

5/28/2019: Added Excel/VBA solutions to my repetoire. Took some getting used to. Finished PE #34 in C++, Java, and Python in 8 minutes, but took 36 minutes to implement Excel/VBA solution.

5/29/2019: Finished PE #35 and #36 in a total of 45 minutes and 58 minutes, respectively.

5/30/2019: Finished PE #37 and #38 in a total of 22 minutes and 21 minutes, respectively.

5/31/2019: Finished PE #39 and PE #40 in a total of 1 hour and 3 minutes and 34 minutes, respectively.
